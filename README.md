# M5-Tab-ESPHome
M5 Tab code, based on GinAndBacon's hard work at https://github.com/GinAndBacon/m5stack-m5tab-lvgl-esphome

The code requires esphome dev branch to compile. Currently running 2025.12.0-dev20251205

Note that none of the image files used (the background, the travel posters etc) are in this repo. You need to supply your own :)
